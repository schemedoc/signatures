"string-index searches through the given substring from the left, returning the index of the leftmost character satisfying the predicate pred. string-index-right searches from the right, returning the index of the rightmost character satisfying the predicate pred. If no match is found, these procedures return #f.
Rationale: The SRFI 130 analogues of these procedures return cursors, even when no match is found, and SRFI 130's string-index-right returns the successor of the cursor for the first character that satisfies the predicate. As there are no cursors in this SRFI, it seems best to follow the more intuitive and long-standing precedent set by SRFI 13.
The start and end arguments specify the beginning and end of the search; the valid indexes relevant to the search include start but exclude end. Beware of \"fencepost\" errors: when searching right-to-left, the first index considered is (- end 1), whereas when searching left-to-right, the first index considered is start. That is, the start/end indexes describe the same half-open interval [start,end) in these procedures that they do in all other procedures specified by this SRFI.
The skip functions are similar, but use the complement of the criterion: they search for the first char that doesn't satisfy pred. To skip over initial whitespace, for example, say
(substring string
            (or (string-skip string char-whitespace?)
                (string-length string))
            (string-length string))

These functions can be trivially composed with string-take and string-drop to produce take-while, drop-while, span, and break procedures without loss of efficiency."))
